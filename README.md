# Movie-Recommender-System-using-Python
---
This project was a part of the Yearly Summer Internship which was undertaken during the month of September, 2021. Given the choice with 3 project ideas, I decided to choose the one which intrigued me quite well – to build a movie recommender system. We get to observe basically any recommender system in our day-to-day life. Be it, YouTube videos, Netflix series, Instagram Sponsored posts, Facebook Ads, etc. All of these recommendations are made possible by the implementation of recommender systems.

Recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms that can suggest “relevant” items to users. They predict future behaviour based on past data through a multitude of techniques including matrix factorization. These are few to mention but in the real world we get to see a lot more applications

The <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/Movie-Recommender-System-using-Python/blob/main/Recommendation%20System.ipynb">Jupyter file</a> contains the main program for building this system. The  report document consists of following sections summarising various aspects of the project in an overview –

1. Problem Formulation
2. Algorithms Followed
3. Dataset Used
4. Results and Discussion
